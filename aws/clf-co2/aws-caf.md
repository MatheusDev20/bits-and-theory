## 🪞 The Six CAF Perspectives

Each **perspective** identifies a **focus area** and recommends **capabilities and stakeholders** needed for a successful cloud journey.

| Perspective | Focus | Key Stakeholders | Goal & Activities |
|-------------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Business** | Business strategy, KPIs, financial drivers, expected cloud outcomes. | Executives, Finance, Business Unit Leaders | Ensure **cloud investments drive measurable business outcomes** (e.g., faster time-to-market, innovation, revenue growth). Define **business case, value realization metrics, funding models**. |
| **People** | Organizational culture, roles, skills, and readiness for change. | HR, Training Teams, Leadership | Build a **cloud-ready workforce and culture**. Plan **training & certification programs, new operating models, change management initiatives**, and align org. structure to cloud goals. |
| **Governance** | Portfolios, policies, compliance, risk management, performance tracking. | PMO, Risk & Compliance, Finance | Establish **decision-making structures, guardrails, and metrics** to guide cloud adoption. Includes **budget controls, compliance frameworks, and KPI dashboards** to minimize risk and maximize value. |
| **Platform** | Technology architecture, foundational services, network & compute. | Cloud Architects, Infra Teams, App Owners | Build a **modern, scalable, secure cloud platform**. Activities: design **landing zones, VPC networking, account structure, hybrid integration**, and migrate workloads with cloud-native best practices. |
| **Security** | Data protection, identity, compliance, threat detection. | Security & Compliance Teams, IAM Admins | Ensure **confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA)** of data and workloads. Implement **identity & access controls, encryption, security monitoring, compliance checks**, and governance guardrails. |
| **Operations** | Day-to-day operations, monitoring, service management, DR/BCP. | Ops/DevOps Teams, Support Teams | Enable **reliable, efficient, and cost-effective operations** to meet SLAs and compliance. Includes **monitoring, incident response, automation, backup/restore, DR plans, and continuous optimization**. |

3. **Launch**  
   - **Pilot migrations** of selected workloads or apps.  
   - Establish the **landing zone, baseline operations, governance guardrails, and security controls**.  
   - Validate approach, collect lessons learned, and refine processes.

4. **Scale**  
   - **Expand adoption at scale** by migrating larger or more critical workloads.  
   - Continuously **optimize costs, security, and performance**.
